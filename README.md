# Photo-Album
Exercies from a Frontend Developer course:
Photo Album is a network for photography lovers. The main page displays sample photos along with their descriptions, authors and number of likes. 
You can view a distinct page for each of the photo, where additionally comments are shown. Profile page is also available.
This is a demo and so an example user is already logged in and not all of the functionalities are programmed yet (f.e. the "Respond" button under the comments).
